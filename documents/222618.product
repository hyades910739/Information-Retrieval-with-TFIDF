To kill common household ants, simply place the pre-filled, ready-to-use liquid ant bait stations near indoor areas where ants are spotted. Ants enter the trap, consume the liquid ant bait, then return to the nest where they pass on the bait to the rest of the colony. Terro Liquid Ant Baits are specifically designed to kill the worker ant in two to three days, giving the foraging ants enough time to share the bait with the rest of the unsuspecting colony. The liquid ant bait stations prevent the bait from drying out and provide the ants with a continuous supply of liquid, day and night.Kills all common household antsConvenient, ready-to-use bait stationPatented design eliminates handling of chemicals and prevents bait from drying outFast-acting formulaContains boraxPlace bait near ant trails or where ants are numerous
