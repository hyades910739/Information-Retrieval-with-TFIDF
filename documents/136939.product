Crown Bolt's serrated flange bolts are hex head bolts with a flanged washer face that has serrations on the bearings surface side. Designed for applications where vibration is present, the teeth grip the surface so that more effort is needed to loosen the screw than tighten it. The built in washer, in some applications, eliminates the need for a lock washer or lock nut.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 information1-piece per bagSteel constructionZinc finish5/16 in.-18 x 2-1/4 in.Grade 5
