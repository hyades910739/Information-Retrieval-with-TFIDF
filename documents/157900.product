Its purpose is to create horizontal details across a building faade. The Cemetrim Collection is guaranteed to enhance the value of any residential of commercial project providing durability and longevity. Our Crown trim mouldings are lighter than cement casted mouldings and stronger than traditional stucco mouldings. The Cemetrim Collection Crown mouldings are designed and engineered for complete compatibility and usage with a wide range of exterior surfaces. They are made following 4 steps to make them durable, sustainable and purely decorative. First step, the comprising type 1 classification EPS (Expanded Polystyrene Foam) is precisely cut by specialized CNC equipment. Second step, a flexible impact resistant fiberglass mesh is adhered into the shape so that it provides not only a bond to the cement coating but also provides strength to the profile. Third step, a first coat of flexible polymer modified crush resistant cement is applied on the face of the profile. Fourth step, the Crown moulding is once again coated a second time to give it strength, stucco texture, consistency and resistance to cracking, delaminating and weather damage. EPS Exterior Cement Coated Stucco mouldings are cost-efficient, light weight, merely decorative and easy to install.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 informationCrown moulding size 8-1/2 in.
