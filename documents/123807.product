If you want your Bellagio pergola to provide ultimate shade, you can purchase an additional shade kit. The Bellagio pergola comes with 1 shade kit (as seen in the pictures) but if you seek additional respite from the sun, you can purchase an extra set. Because the shade slats are made from quality PVC, you can drill the included screws right through the shade slats into the top of your pergola for a simple and secure installation.
