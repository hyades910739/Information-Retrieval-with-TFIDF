Cuts extremely hard abrasive materials are Laminates, fiberglass, ceramic tile, marble, slate, cast iron and composites. Cutting edge of tungsten carbide particles bonded to alloy steel back. High heat and abrasion resistance, no teeth to dull or chip, resists snagging, smooth cutting, and greater wear resistance. Ideal for plumbing, construction, marine and aircraft applications.Designed to cut difficult materialMade from a durable bonding processThis saw resists not only heat, but wear and tearFor use on most surfaces
