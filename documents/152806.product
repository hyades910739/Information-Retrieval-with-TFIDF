The shafts are hollow and provide ideal operation when working on electrical panels, HVAC/R panels and stacked circuit boards. The nut drivers are made with donut-shaped magnetic tips to easily hold fasteners securely in place. The Cushion-Grip handles provide greater torque and are color-coded for easy identification of compatible tips.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 informationMade with chrome-plated shafts to help prevent corrosionShafts are hollow to enhance work on long bolt applications and provide unobstructed pass-throughShafts provide ideal operation when working on electrical panels, HVAC/R panels and stacked circuit boardsMade with donut-shaped magnetic tips to easily hold fasteners securely in placeConstructed with cushion-grip handles to provide greater torqueColor-coded handles with tip-ident allow you to easily identify the correct size for compatibilityFeatures internal flanges to provide a solid, twist-resistant shaft anchor3/16 in. driver does not have hollow shaftIncludes drivers with catalog numbers: 630-3/16M, 630-1/4M, 630-5/16M, 630-11/32M, 630-3/8M, 630-7/16M and 630-1/2MMade in the USA
