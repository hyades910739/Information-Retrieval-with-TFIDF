Patty Tuggle has always wanted to be an artist, even as a child. A talent and appreciation passed down from her grandmother and mother, Tuggle excelled early in her career winning awards as a student. She continues to garner praise and place highly at juried shows and exhibitions in her adult career. She hopes that through her work she is able to evoke hope, happiness, and understanding and sometimes even sadness, despair or anger. Of her work Tuggle says, "Nothing can compare to God's creations, I merely want to capture those creations or situations that you may have missed"This ready to hang, gallery-wrapped art piece features purple flowers near a lakeGiclee (jee-clay) is an advanced printmaking process for creating high quality fine art reproductions, the attainable excellence that giclee printmaking affords makes the reproduction virtually indistinguishable from the original pieceArtist: Patty TuggleSubject: FloralStyle: ContemporaryProduct Type: Gallery-Wrapped Canvas ArtMade in USA
