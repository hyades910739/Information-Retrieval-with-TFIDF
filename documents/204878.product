Enter a paradise in your own backyard with the Sarasota Plus 7 person hot tub. This spa features contoured seats with walk-in steps, a large foot well, and stainless steel jets. A 1.5 HP Hi-flow energy efficient pump powers this spa for a therapeutic jet massage. The Econo-Boost energy recovery system recovers the heat generated by the pump and motor and returns it to the spa to help warm the water. This Green method of heat recycling saves money and precious natural resources. QCA Spas require far less energy than any other spa in its class and far exceeds the California Energy Compliance mandate. The spa shell is manufactured with Lucite-xtra acrylic in a Silver Marble color.
