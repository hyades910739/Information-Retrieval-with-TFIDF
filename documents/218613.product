Dekton is a sophisticated blend of the raw materials used to produce the very latest in glass and porcelain as well as the highest quality quartz surfaces. The result is an entirely new product that is made by putting the minerals found within glass, porcelain and quartz-based surfaces under extreme heat and pressure, simulating the metamorphic change that natural stone undergoes when subjected to high temperatures and pressure over thousands of years only accelerated through our high tech process. This unique combination of raw materials and cutting-edge technology makes Dekton an extremely durable material with unrivaled performance characteristics.Highly resistant to scratching and abrasion; great for a busy kitchenHigh UV resistance making it the perfect outdoor material with color that won't fade over timeHighly resistant to fire, heat and cold - will not scorch or crack under extreme temperaturesStain proof and highly resistant to household chemicalsNon-porous surface that never needs to be sealed and is easy to cleanUltra-sized slabs result in fewer seams and more design flexibility
