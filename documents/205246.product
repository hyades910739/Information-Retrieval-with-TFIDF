Designed to be both beautiful and functional, louvers have been a useful design accent for centuries. Fypon offers two basic louver types, functional (venting) and decorative (non-venting), in a multitude of shapes that fit most architectural styles. Designed to provide optimum ventilation, functional louvers feature angled slats to help protect interiors from the elements. The inside of the functional louver has a corrosion-resistant screen that helps keep insects out while allowing airflow between the slats. Accessory pieces, such as flat trim and keystones are also available for many louver styles.Lifetime limited warranty for homeownersLow-maintenanceQuick and easy installationResists insectsResists moistureWeather resistantPre-primed, ready to paint or stainExterior grade 100% acrylic latex paintImages are representative of style, actual product will vary by size
