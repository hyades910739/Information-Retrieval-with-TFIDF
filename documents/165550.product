PelletVent is a complete venting system from DuraVent for stoves and inserts that use oil fuel or multi-fuels (including wood pellets, corn, cherry pits, switch grass, coffee husks, walnut shells, soybeans, wheat, sunflower hulls, rapeseed and sugar beets). The 3 in. Storm Collar helps prevent water leakage in the home by deflecting rain and moisture from the vent pipe. Designed for use with a 3 in. round vent pipe, the storm collar seals securely with silicone (sold separately) to ensure reliable, lasting performance. For added durability, PelletVent seams are factory-sealed on all elbows, tees and fittings.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 informationDurable steel construction resists corrosion to ensure lasting useDeflects rain and moisture from the vent pipe to help prevent water from leaking into your homeDesigned for use with pellet stoves onlySized for 3 in. round vent pipeDesigned to be sealed to the vent pipe with high-temperature silicone sealant (not included)UL listed for 3 in. clearance to combustibles in the USA and Canada (always check your local fire codes)PelletVent offers a limited lifetime warranty
