Eco-friendly and wonderfully casual, the Uragon Mini Table Lamp lends rustic-chic charm to any design theme from coastal cottage to urban loft. Artisans thoroughly clean and bleach found root wood, arrange it in an interesting composition on a black stand, and crown each lamp with a natural shade woven of eco-friendly hemp. This is a great companion for your home whether in the country side or in the busy city.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 informationShade material: 100% hempRoot wood base provides added stabilityMinor assembly required70.8 in. cord provides an ample reach
