Handrails make any stair more stable and safer to use, but they also add beauty and elegance to your stair. Our Engineered Rail uses a patented flower joint technology that makes joints in the rail nearly invisible. They can be cut, sanded and drilled to accept wood or metal balusters. Use matching handrail fittings to allow your handrail to climb, turn, ascend or terminate in a graceful manner. This stair part is designed for interior use only. They can be finished to match other stair parts or interior decor. From stair treads, stair railing and a complete selection of stair parts, SureWood-LNL has what you need to make your stairs beautiful.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 informationUse where sub rails are required for codePerfect for secondary rails or basement rails where grasp ability codes do not applyMatches 71xx series handrail fittingsUse standard handrail brackets for mountingComplements your stair railing system
