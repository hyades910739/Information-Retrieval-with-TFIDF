Siemens offers a wide array of thermal-magnetic circuit breakers that are the key element for overload and short-circuit protection of your home's electrical system. To provide additional protection Siemens offers circuit breakers to protect against severe electrical shock or electrocution, mitigate the risk of electrical fires and protect against damaging surges and Voltage spikes. Circuit breakers are intended for switching and protection of your home's wiring from high temperatures caused by excess current higher than the rating of the wire. While thermal-magnetic circuit breakers are the key element for overload and short-circuit protection of your electrical system, there are potentially dangerous conditions that do not involve over current.2-pole, 50-Amp 120V/240V type QP circuit breaker10,000 AIC interrupting ratingSiemens type QP circuit breakers provide easy plug-in connections in Siemens enclosures and the time saving insta-wire featureCompatible with Siemens PL and ES series load centersUse for overload and short-circuit protection of your electrical systemThermal-magnetic
