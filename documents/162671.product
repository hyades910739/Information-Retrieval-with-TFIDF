The DEWALT DC822KL Cordless Impact Wrench is a compact, lightweight tool that produces a surprising amount of raw screw-driving power. This heavy-duty, -1/2 in. -drive tool weighs just 3.7 lbs., and is only 5-3/4 in. long, but it can take on the toughest, most-demanding fastening jobs, such as tightening large bolts, loosening stubborn lug nuts, and driving extra-long lag screws.
