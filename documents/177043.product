Alsa's 12 oz. Base Pearls all purpose custom paint comes in a specially formulated spray can that delivers a fine, even spray. Our Killer cans have a high output with excellent atomization that eliminates pressure drop during application. Base Pearls use a pearlescent pigment that produces an iridescent luster effect resembling mother-of-pearl. The colors are deep, vibrant and bright.
