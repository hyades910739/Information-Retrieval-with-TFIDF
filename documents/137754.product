The simple lines of the Sonoma Single Vanity create a striking silhouette with modest crown molding and slightly tapered legs. The bath vanity cabinet features recessed door and drawer panels and metal pulls in a chrome finish. A white marble top completes the look of this modern bathroom vanity. Crafted of natural marble, the vanity top may contain swirling or veining. These features are part of the natural beauty of stone and have no effect on function or durability.White European carrara marble top is pre-drilled for your faucet (faucets not included)Includes backsplashWhite ceramic sink2 working soft-close drawers and 2 faux drawers1 soft-close door with adjustable interior shelfZinc hardware in chrome finish34.5 in.
