Used to supply power, usually from a pole-mounted transformer, to the user's service head where connection to the service entrance cable is made. To be used at voltages of 600-Volts phase-to-phase or less. To be used at conductor temperatures not to exceed 75C for polyethylene insulated conductors or 90C for cross-linked polyethylene (XLP) insulated conductors. Southwire's triplex service drop cable meets or exceeds all applicable requirements of ANSI/ICEA S-76-474.Conductors are concentrically stranded, compressed 1350-H19 aluminumInsulated with either polyethylene or cross-linked polyethylene (XLP)Neutral messengers are concentrically stranded 6201, AAC or ACSRHas aluminum conductors, polyethylene or cross-linked polyethylene insulation
