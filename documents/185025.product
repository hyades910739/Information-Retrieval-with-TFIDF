The Dual Function Circuit Breaker combines GFCI and AFCI, protecting against both Arc Faults and Ground Faults. This, along with the new Self-Test and Lockout feature, makes it the first in class in electrical safety for homeowners. The 2014 National Electrical Code (NEC) now requires both Arc Fault and Ground Fault protection on kitchen and laundry circuits. Before the release of Dual Function Circuit Breakers, the only option to comply with this code was to pair an AFCI circuit breaker with a GFCI receptacle. The Dual Function Circuit breaker combines these 2 devices into once solution that provides both cost savings and less hassle in installation and maintenance. This is a win solution for everyone. Testing GFCI's and AFCI's on a monthly basis is a good idea that is sometimes forgotten. Underwriters Laboratories (UL) suggests that AFCI/GFCI devices be tested every 30 days after installation to ensure they are properly working. Now the new Self-Test and Lockout feature enables the Dual Function Circuit Breaker to automatically and continuously test itself to ensure that it is working properly. If it is detected that the device has been compromised, the device trips itself and locks out the homeowner from resetting the device, reducing the possibility of the homeowner incorrectly assuming that the device was tripped to prevent a ground/arc fault. This effortless system guarantees that only the best protection is given to your home at all times.Faster installation compared to installing an AFCI breaker and GFI receptacleLower cost compared to AFCI breaker and GFCI receptacleSelf-test and lockout feature as required by UL 943 effective June 2015Siemens exclusive LED trip indicator pinpoints cause of tripHACR, SWD, 120-Volt AC ratedWire range: #14-#8 AWG copper or #12-#8 AWG aluminum
