These hex bolts have hexagonal heads and are for general purpose applications with a socket type installation tool or standard wrench. The standard bolt is compatible with standard nuts and washers of the same thread pitch, grade, and finish. Grade 8 bolts have a higher strength and are to be used with Grade 8 nuts. An alternative for using hex bolts without nuts is to place them directly into a compatible female threaded receptacle. They require a pre drilled hole or pre-tapped hole with compatible female thread. Available in various materials, grades, and finishes.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 information100-piece per boxSteel constructionZinc-plated1/4 in. -20 tpi x 3 in.Coarse threadHead code AJD
