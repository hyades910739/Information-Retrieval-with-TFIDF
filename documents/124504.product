The Honeywell ALLERGEN PLUS is made of a self-supported pleated media offered at a value. The unique filter construction of Honeywell ALLERGEN PLUS requires less energy for lower energy cost. Its electrostatic charge and larger surface area of pleated material improves the efficiency of its dust-holding capacity. Housed in a recyclable clay-coated moisture resistant frame, this filter captures particles as small as 1 micron. In comparison, a human hair is approximately 150 microns in size. The Honeywell is effective against the following contaminants: microscopic allergens, bacteria, disintegrated feces, tobacco smoke, insecticide dust, lead dust, mold spores, pollen, pet dander, nuisance dust, and dust mite debris. The leader in the air filtration, Flanders provides air filtration products for pharmaceutical laboratories, the space programs, nuclear containment, and commercial industries.Filter performance rating is 7Moisture resistant frameElectro-statically chargedLasts up to 90 daysCheck out the features for air filters that are FPR 6-7
