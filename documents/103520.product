Makita's 6 SJS Angle Grinder combines 10.5 Amp power with comfort and motor-protection features for longer-lasting industrial performance. It is engineered with Makita's innovative SJS mechanical clutch system that helps protect the gears for longer tool life. The GA6020YX1 is powered by a 10.5 Amp motor that delivers 10,000 RPM, with electric brake for maximum productivity. Labyrinth construction protects the motor with a complex set of channels, prohibiting dust and contamination. In addition, the protective Zigzag varnish seals the motor and bearings from dust and debris by creating a barrier under rotation. It is engineered with SJS mechanical clutch system, an innovation from Makita that protects the gears by automatically disengaging the motor should the grinding wheel accidentally catch or bind. The GA6020YX1 weighs only 6.7 lbs. and is built with comfort and ergonomic features for extended use, including an ergonomic rubberized rear handle with trigger switch. In addition, the side handle can be easily installed on either side of the tool. It is a versatile and powerful grinder engineered for demanding applications including cutting, ferrous metal, paint and rust removal, shipyard maintenance, heavy machinery, metal polishing, general steel grinding, auto repair work, cutting brick and masonry, and restoration work. The grinder is built for welders, fabricators, plumbers, masons, electricians, automotive technicians.Powerful 10.5 Amp motor delivers 10,000 RPM to handle the most demanding applicationsSJS technology is a mechanical clutch system that helps prevent motor and gear damage by allowing the drive shaft to slip if the wheel is forced to stopSpiral bevel gears for smoother rotations and a more efficient transfer of energyZigzag varnish protects the armature coil from dust and debris for longer motor lifeLabyrinth construction prevents debris from penetrating the motor, bearings and gears for longer tool lifeAC/DC switch for use with alternative power sourceExternally accessible brushes for greater serviceabilityRear handle and trigger design for more comfort during extended use"Tool-less" grinding wheel guard for more convenient adjustmentsIncludes both cutting/grinding wheels and guards
