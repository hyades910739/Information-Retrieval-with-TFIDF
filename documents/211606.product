Maintaining proper humidity levels between 30-50% in your home/office/workplace has been scientifically proven to help prevent the flu and allergies.  Proper humidity hydrates your skin, alleviates dry eyes, scratchy throats and can reduce snoring.  With a doctor's approval increased humidity can reduce asthma and allergy symptoms.  It also protects fine furniture, musical instruments, collectibles and wood floors.
