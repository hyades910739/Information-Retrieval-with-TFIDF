The GROHE Grandera collection is both a homage to an age of grandeur long past and an affirmation of a modern sensibility, combining the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship with a love of detail and comfort. Stylistically, the Grandera collection can be combined with a wide range of bathroom furnishings, with the added flexibility of two colors - chrome and chrome/gold. Thanks to GROHE StarLight technology, not only will the fittings retain their shine in the long term but they are also extremely resistant to dirt and scratches.Solid brass constructionGROHE SilkMove ceramic cartridgeMetal lever handleGROHE WaterSense
