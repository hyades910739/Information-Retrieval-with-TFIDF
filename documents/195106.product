Create ambiance with a perfect balance of warmth and style with the Aspen Collection.  The mahogany solids and cherry veneers of the Aspen Kitchen Island are warmed with a multi-step rustic cherry finish while recessed door panels, a profiled edge top, and bold molding detail draw the eye deeper in.  Storage function can be found in the four storage drawers and a storage cabinet with one adjustable shelf, but what makes this island really unique is the hidden sliding mechanism connected to the back two posts.  The mechanism provides easy mobility and independent movement of the two posts for expansion of the breakfast bar.  Either with the breakfast bar closed or in use, this piece has a polished look by being consistently styled on both the approach and working sides.  With the breakfast bar extended, the top surface depth expands from 26-3/4 in. to 39 in.  The Aspen Bar Stool is constructed of hardwood solids and has a seat height that measures 24 in. high  This set includes the kitchen island and two bar stools. Island Size: 48 in. W x 26-3/4 in.
