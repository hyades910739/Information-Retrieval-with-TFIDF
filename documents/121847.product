The Inductor 8 in. Corded In-Line Duct Fan is engineered to overcome back pressure and boost air in forced air heating and cooling systems without upsetting the balance in the closed loop system. The DB208C boosts airflow in ducts with low air delivery to improve comfort and energy efficiency. If you have rooms that are too hot or too cold due to poor airflow, this is an efficient and economical solution.UL listed E227633 heating and cooling equipment UL 1995 and CSA C22.2 no. 236210 CFM free air to maximum boosted air 500 CFMThermally protected class B motor with automatic reset thermal fuseEngineered polycarbonate blade to minimize noise and vibration6 ft. heavy duty SJT 3 conductor 18-Gauge grounded cordCrimp and bead on 1 end for easy installationInstalls in any positionCorrosion-resistant galvanized metalInstallation screws includedPlugs right into the DuctStat, model DS100, (sold separately) for automatic temperature controlled on/of operation
