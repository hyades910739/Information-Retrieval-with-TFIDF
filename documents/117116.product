Photo catalytic oxidation is achieved when UV ray combines with a TiO2-coated filter. This process creates hydroxyl radicals and super-oxide ions, which are highly reactive electrons. These electrons aggressively combine with other elements in the air, such as bacteria and volatile organic compounds (VOC), which are harmful pollutants. Once bound together, the chemical reaction takes place between the super-charges ion and the pollutant, effectively oxidizing or burning the pollutant. This breaks the pollutant down into harmless carbon dioxide and water molecules.Replacement TiO2 Filter for AC-2102Oxidizing bacteria and volatile organic compounds into harmless carbon dioxide and water moleculesManufactured to the highest specificationsMade in Taiwan
