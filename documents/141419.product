When you choose this stainless steel braided supply line, you're choosing a product that starts with an extruded core of PVC tubing. The core is then over-braided with polyester yarn and another layer of PVC material. The final layer consists of stainless steel braid to form a strong, yet flexible supply line. Brass nuts on both ends ensure a solid connection on the inlet and outlet ends.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 informationStainless steel braiding over braided PVC for strengthUse to hook up your dishwasher to the water supplyIncludes an assortment of fittings to accommodate any requirementsMaximum working pressure 125 psiNote: product may vary by storeComplete kit includes all fittings that will be neededSupply line made of PVC with stainless steel braid overlayAll fittings are brass or chrome plated brass
