MDL Fuses are slo-blo, time delay glass tube fuses. Fuses help prevent electrical current overload by breaking a connection when an overload occurs and time delay fuses are rated on how long they can handle the overload. They can also be used in other electrical applications, mainly for less current overload sensitive items. Ratings are listed in amps and volts and must match fuses being replaced.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 information1-pieceGlass constructionClear finish1-1/4 in. length1/2-amp
