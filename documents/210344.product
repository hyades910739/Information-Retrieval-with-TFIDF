Heavy distressing on the deep grey finish gives this console the look of an elegant antique, channeling a nostalgic atmosphere reminiscent of well-loved reclaimed and restored vintage furniture. The table's distinctive V-shaped container shelf helps gives this piece its unique magnetic character while providing extra storage and display space; its well-angled design neatly holds and displays books, CDs, movies, and more in a subtle yet accessible location. A large 48 in. x 16 in. rectangular table top offers generous surface area for photographs, vases, lamps, and other decorative items, while the single pull-out drawer creates additional storage space perfect for items like pens and paper, media accessories, and other often-used items that tend to create clutter in the home. Designed with classic and rustic styles in mind, the console's gentle lines and graceful proportions draw inspiration from the simplicity of the natural world. Tasteful accents, like the slim, elegantly turned legs ending in trestle feet, contribute to its personality, creating a sense of timelessness that will never go out of style.Distinctive V-shaped lower container shelf neatly holds and displays items like books and CDsUpper pull-out drawer provides additional storage to keep often-used items organized and close at handScaled-down profile is perfect for smaller hallways, entryways, or cozy nooksMinimal assembly required; table measures 48 in.
