The Honeywell Superior Allergen is made of a reinforced pleated media with a large surface area which improves the efficiency of its dust-holding capacity. The unique constructions of Honeywell Superior Allergen filters require less energy for lower energy cost. Its electrostatic charge helps attract particles magnetically that otherwise would pass through. Housed in a recyclable clay-coated moisture resistant frame, this filter captures particles as small as 1 micron. In comparison, a human hair is approximately 100 micron in size. The Honeywell Superior Allergen is effective against the following contaminants: dust/lint, airborne dust mite debris, pollen, pet dander, mold spores, bacteria, microscopic allergens, virus carriers and most smoke.Filter performance rating (FPR): 9Filters down to the micro particle levelElectro-statically chargedHeavy-duty moisture resistant frameLasts up to 90 daysCheck out the features for air filters that are FPR 8-9
