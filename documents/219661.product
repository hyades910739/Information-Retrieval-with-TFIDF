Command Hooks are available in a wide range of designs to match your individual style and decor. They also come in a variety of sizes and hold a surprising amount of weight - up to seven and a half pounds. Forget about nails, screws and tacks, Command Hooks are fast and easy to hang. Using the revolutionary Command Adhesive, stick to many surfaces, including paint, wood, tile and more. Yet, they also come off leaving no holes, marks, sticky residue or stains. Rehanging them is as easy as applying a Command Refill Strip, so you can take down, move and reuse them again and again.Damage-free hangingWeight capacity: 5 lbs.Size: largeColor: whitePackage contents: 6 hooks, 12 stripsHolds strongly and removes cleanlyEasy to apply and removeWorks on a variety of surfaces
