The Mini-Trol water shock suppressors absorb water hammer to eliminate noisy pipes and pressure surges caused by fast-acting valves. Unlike piston like suppressors, the Mini-Trol contains no mechanical parts or seals. Resulting in a maintenance-free shock absorber that provides years of reliable protection.Proprietary, sealed design never requires chargingSuperior water hammer capacityDurable and corrosion proofImpact resistant polymerPatent-pending technology provides more than twice the life of other designsNo pistons or seals to wear outConnection: 1/2 in.
