KRAUS stainless steel sink and faucet combinations offer great savings on best-selling kitchen products. Handcrafted from premium 16-Gauge T-304 stainless steel for maximum durability, the sink creates a contemporary look for the kitchen. Extra-deep basins accommodate large dishes with ease. The tight-radius corners and clean lines of the design complement transitional and modern kitchens alike. All KRAUS kitchen sinks are equipped with top-level soundproofing, including thick rubber dampening pads. Each sink is additionally treated with protective StoneGuard coating, which reduces condensation and further dampens sound. The corrosion-resistant surface is further protected from rust and oxidation by a meticulous finishing process. Commercial grade satin finish and gently rounded corners make maintenance as simple as wiping the surface with a damp cloth. For a streamlined look and easy installation, this sink is paired with a best-selling commercial-style kitchen faucet. Each faucet features top-quality components, including a high performance water-efficient aerator and a precision ceramic cartridge for reliable drip-free use.
