The LPN80 LoProfile fan is designed for installations where conventional ventilation simply won't fit. When a multi-family application requires it, the LoProfile fan is narrow enough to be installed in a wall between 2x4 studs. When plumbing or electrical obstructions are found behind the drywall in ceiling remodel applications, the LoProfile fan can still fit without having to move anything. And that means most any room with space constraints can have powerful, quiet efficient ventilation.Narrow enough to fit in 2 in. x 4 in. ceiling or wall construction80 CFM ensures ample air movement1.0 sones for extremely quiet operationMounting ears and hanger bar for fast and easy installationENERGY STAR qualified efficient operation for lower utility billsPlug-in, permanently lubricated motor - engineered for continuous operationDynamically balanced centrifugal blower wheel for quiet, efficient performanceUL listed for use over bathtubs and showers when connected to a GFCI protected branch circuit (ceiling mount only)Can be mounted in flat ceilings, sloped ceilings up to 12/12 pitch, and wallsIncludes 4 in. oval to 3 in. round duct reducerHome Depot Protection Plan:
