The 1/2 in. SharkBite x 1/2 in. Female Pipe Thread Ball Valve is the easiest way to install a new or replacement shut-off ball valve. The single lever control allows for easy operation and the valve is perfect for potable water and hydronic applications where a shut-off is needed. SharkBite fittings allow you to join copper, CPVC or PEX pipe in any combination with no soldering, clamps, unions or glue. Just insert the pipe and the stainless steel teeth bite down and grip tight, while a specially formulated O-ring compresses to create a perfect seal. Disassembly is just as fast using the simple disconnect tool so fittings and valves can be easily changed and reused. They can even be rotated after assembly for easier installation in tight spaces. Get SharkBite and get a grip on your next plumbing project.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 informationLead free DZR brass construction for durability and reliabilityUse-to-connect to any combination of copper, PEX, CPVC, or PE-RT pipesInnovative push-to-connect design makes for quick and easy installationPush-to-connect fittings require no solder, glue, unions, or toolsFitting can be rotated on pipe after installation making it easier to work in tight spacesDesigned for potable water distribution as well as hydronic heating applicationsCorrosion resistant to improve longevityCertified as a manufactured joint and for underground and behind-the-wall applications without access panelsListed by IAPMO and design certified and listed to ASSE 1061/NSF 61Meets all UPC, IPC, and cUPC requirementsDemount clip allows user to release the fitting from the pipe for convenient installation flexibility (sold separately)Rated to 200F and 200 PSI
