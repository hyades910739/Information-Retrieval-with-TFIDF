ANViL Deck-A-New Wood and Concrete Textured Resurfacer is a rejuvenator coating for weathered or damaged wood and concrete surfaces. Deck-A-New's beautiful textured solid color finish repairs, structurally sound, wooden and composite decks, concrete patios, walkways steps and porches while offering maximum protections to preserve the surface for years. The coating encapsulates splinters and fills cracks delivering a beautiful slip resistant finish that is scuff, peel and chip resistant. Protect both interior/exterior vertical/horizontal wood and concrete surfaces with lasting durability. Wooden surfaces: replace rotting or unstable decking boards and remove all loose splinters. Clean the surface to remove mildew, dirt and oil prior to application. Level all nail or screw heads. Concrete surfaces: remove all dirt, efflorescence, grease, oil, waxes, silicone products and other foreign material that would interfere with the adhesion of Deck-A-New. Un-coated smooth steel-toweled concrete floors (floors with no porosity) must be totally cured and cleaned with ANViL Clean and Etch #1450. For best results, must apply two coats by brush, roller or texture sprayer. For normal aged wood, composite or concrete decks use a synthetic roller with a 3/8 in. nap. For extremely weathered, cracked and damaged wood decks, apply with a nylon-loop textured roller. Apply product at a rate of 120 to 160 sq. ft. per gallon, depending on porosity (60-80 sq. ft. in two coats).Rejuvenates and restores wood decks and concreteLocks down splinters and fills cracks up to 1/4 in. interior or exteriorSave over 1,000 dollars in wood deck replacement costsSolid color textured slip-resistant finishCRACK AND PEELING RESISTANTGREAT FOR POOL DECKSEASY APPLICTIONSOAP AND WATER CLEAN UPOnline Price includes Paint Care fee in the following states: CA, CO, CT, MN, OR, RI, VT
