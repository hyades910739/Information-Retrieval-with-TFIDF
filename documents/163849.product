You should check your vacuum cleaner's rotating floor brush and drive belt regularly for wear or damage. This particular Bissell belt is designed to keep your cleaner running at the optimum performance. When looking at the belt, replace if it is broken or worn. The drive belt is a critical component of your vacuum that allows the brush roll to spin and help remove dirt and debris from your carpets. If your vacuum is not cleaning as well as it had before or the brush roll has stopped turning, you may have to change the belt. If you notice a rubber smell coming from your vacuum you should check your belt for any signs of wear. To change the belt, please refer to your user guide for installation instructions.Belt fits Bissell units that use style: 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16For Vacuum Models: Velocity Series, PowerTrak Cyclonic, Momentum Series, PowerGlide Series, All CleanView Series, All PowerForce Series, Pet Hair EraserWorks with Model #s: 20Q9, 21K3, 22C1, 3522, 3574, 3910, 3920, 3990, 4104, 46E5, 6390W, 6582, 6583, 6584, 6585, 6594, 6596, 71Y7, 82G7, 82H1, 92L3P, 3576 series, 92L3, 44M3, 3545, 6579You should check your vacuum cleaner's rotating floor brush and drive belt regularly for wear or damageBissell belt is easy to change and a screwdriver may be needed to access the brush roll housing and should be changed once every 6 to 12 months
