Oz-Post offers a special range of products designed for steel post market and other applications that utilize round tubing for posts. This line of products utilizes Oz-Post patented compression collar attachment for an attractive secure connection with the post. When installed as recommended the connection will provide a strong foundation for the construction project. To summarize, you can leave the top sleeve completely above ground, half in half out (recommended) or completely bury the top sleeve out of sight. When burying the sleeve completely be sure the sleeve is clear of dirt to get a firm connection with the post. There are grooves at the bottom of the sleeve that grip the post keeping the collar in place.Fits 2 3/8 in. round steel posts6-Pieces per caseHot dipped galvanized anchorSuitable for contact with acq approved lumber
