An afternoon spent on your patio can be a stolen moment in time. Deep outdoor seating that lets you relax. And a place to get away from it all that's what outdoor sectionals were made for. And that's why we designed the Cannes Collection by RST Outdoor. Modular components make this outdoor furniture set versatile and perfect for any size space or occasion. It's where form and function meet comfort in an outdoor seating collection made to kick back and relax on your personal French Riviera. Rich, hand woven, weathered grey colored polyethylene wicker provides a stunning contrast to any landscaping back-drop. Seating components arrive at your door fully assembled and only minor assembly is required for the coffee and side tables where included. Bring class and harmony to your outdoor living area with the distinctive Slate product collection. These classic blue tones in the cushion and matching, stripped accent pillow fabric bring just the right note to your patio. Padded components are clad in sunsharp material. The rich cushion and pillow colors will give you years of pleasure. The seating cushions feature the RST Outdoor, patent pending, Quick Change covers that allow them to be easily removed for cleaning and replacement. This also gives you the ability to customize the cushion colors for a new look and feel to your backyard oasis.
