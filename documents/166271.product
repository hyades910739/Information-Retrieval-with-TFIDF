The Lifestyle 52 in. x 30 in. is a tub that allows the therapeutic benefits of a horizontal bathtub to be realized on a vertical format. Add to that the fact that there is no climbing in and out, and the benefits of this tub prove countless. With the creation of the Lifestyle 52 in. x 30 in., all the benefits of a traditional tub are now in a vertical position, mirroring the position of a traditional outdoor spa. With the 52 in. x 30 in. footprint, standard 8 in. filler shelf and extension panel, a retrofit into an existing 60 in. x 30 in. or 60 in. x 32 in. opening now allows for more options and a roomier bathing experience with this design of tub. Compared to similar style tubs on the market, this unit has a lower threshold, comfortable seat height and, with its 40 in. overall height and wider seat, provides more room and a better soaking height while seated.Acrylic materialRectangular single person tub8 fully directional adjustable PVC jets2.25-HP single speed pumpAnti-vortex safety suction, automatic purge and dry cycleSoft touch electronic on/off control with 30 minute timer
