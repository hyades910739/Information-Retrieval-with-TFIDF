These machine screws are used with nuts or directly into a female threaded receptacle to fasten metal parts together. They are installed into an existing or predrilled, pre-tapped hole and are fully threaded. Measurements are made from the underside of the head to the tip of the screw to obtain fastener length. If nuts are needed, use with nuts of the same material, finish, and threading for proper fit.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 informationFor general applicationsZinc-plated finish1-3/4 in. fastener lengthCombination drive styleIncludes 50 screws
