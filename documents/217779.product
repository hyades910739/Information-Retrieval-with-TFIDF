Gregory O'Hanlon is attracted by shapes, patterns and textures found in the natural and man-made worlds. It is the co-existence and interaction between these environments, enhanced through the interplay of light and the changing seasons, that inspire his appreciation. Gregory's photographs capture forever the transitory alignment of these elements. A transformation occurs through a combination of specialized skill and creative vision. Subtle yet precise digital manipulation of the images shape the scene to reveal its essence.This gallery-wrapped art piece features a composition with a public monument and the White House in the Background.Giclee (jee-clay) is an advanced printmaking process for creating high quality fine art reproductions.
