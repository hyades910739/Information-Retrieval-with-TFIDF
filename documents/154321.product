The Shark Rotator Powered Lift-Away is our first ever Powered Lift-Away providing uninterrupted floor to ceiling cleaning. Easily clean under and around furniture, above the floor, and all those other hard to reach places in your home. The LED light in the handle is perfect for above floor cleaning and great for spotting cobwebs in those bothersome corners. This comes in particularly handy when you use a handle attachment, like the upholstery tool. Fingertip controls aid in a seamless transition between hard floors and carpet. This 3-in-1 vacuum instantly transforms to a portable canister with powered floor nozzle using the canister caddy. In addition, the caddy can hold all of your favorite attachments so they are available at all times. The new Hard Floor Genie bare floor attachment offers the ultimate bare floor cleaning experience and includes a microfiber pad to pick up the finer debris. Advanced swivel steering provides the ultimate control to get in and around obstacles and furniture. Anti-Allergen Complete Seal Technology traps over 99.99% of dust and allergens inside the vacuum while passing through a HEPA filter. The Shark Rotator Powered Lift-Away also features the new 2-in-1 Dusting Genie for fine dusting, a pet upholstery tool to lift all those animal hairs off the living room couch, and a dusting brush. A generous 30 ft. long power cord makes easy work of cleaning large areas, and our 7-year warranty ensures that your experience will be trouble free.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 informationDeep clean with extreme under furniture reach while using the powered lift-away motorized brush3-in-1 vacuum: powerful upright, lift away pod with powered brush roll and convenient canister with caddyHard-floor genie attachment for superior bare floor cleaning with washable microfiber padNever loses suction technologyLightweight and ultra-quietRotator technology with advanced swivel steeringHome Depot Protection Plan:
