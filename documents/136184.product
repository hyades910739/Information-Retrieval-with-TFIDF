Get the most from your sander with this high-performance sandpaper. Each disc has a durable tear-resistant backing that is thickly coated with super-sharp aluminum oxide grits. The quick-cutting abrasive grits are bonded in place with a commercial-grade resin adhesive that resists friction heat, resulting in longer life. And a stearate coating greatly reduces gummy buildup, even when sanding sap-soaked softwoods. Use these DEWALT discs for sanding wood, removing paint, smoothing sharp edges, and knocking down clear-coat finishes.Stearate coating reduces gum-upPremium aluminum oxide grain removes material more efficientlyResin adhesive resists heat build-upChemically treated backing resists tearing
