With its patented Anystream 360 technology, the hand shower allows for an easy transition through 360 of full-flood needling spray, central pulsating massage, or a combination of both settings by simply rotating the showerhead's faceplate. Connecting the base of the hand shower to the shower hose is an ADA compliant pause/trickle adapter which permits the water source to be turned on or off, allowing ease of operation for those with physical handicaps. The wall mounted shower elbow sources water directly to the handshower attached to the 22 inch slide bar. This adjustable attachment provides customization of the height of the hand shower. The diverter tub spout allows an easy switch between tub and shower use, and the Caspian anti-scald pressure balance shower valve maintains consistent temperature while in use. ADA compliant shower systems offer several advantages, including accessibility for handicapped persons. This luxury shower system pairs well with any Caspian bathroom faucet or fixture accessories set to exemplify contemporary style in any bathroom.VS-3014 hand shower with Anystream 360 degree spray adjusting faceplateDurable 60 inch metal shower hose with integrated vacuum breaker, ADA pause/trickle adapter and shower elbow22 inch SA-1202 slide barSM-7000-P anti-scald pressure balance shower valave with trimS-1562 tub spout with diverterContemporary hotel design
