Crown Bolt's sheet metal screws, or tapping screws, are highly versatile and are used to attach metal, wood, fiberglass, and plastic. The sharp threads draw material together and ensure a secure hold. Made from hardened steel, the threads create their own mating thread. Self drilling sheet metal screws are fully threaded and possess a drill point enabling it to pilot in its own hole in light gauge steel. No pre drilled holes necessary.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 information3-piece per bagSteel constructionBrass plated finish#8 x 3/4 in.Flat head Phillips drive
