These nylon lock nuts are hexagonal nuts used with bolts and washers of the same material, finish and grade. The nylon ring creates rotational resistance when displaced by a mating male threaded fastener, thus preventing loosening. The nylon insert also helps resist vibration and adds extra corrosion resistance.
