Make a bold statement with the KRAUS Kitchen Combination, featuring Geo Axis. We've created a kitchen workstation with maximum visual impact by pairing a spacious granite sink with one of our most distinctive faucets. Striking black insets in the faucet body complement the color of the sink, creating a perfectly matched look that reflects the natural beauty of stone. The Geo Axis Single Lever Pull Out Faucet has a unique two-tone design with Stainless/Spot Less Black Onyx finish. Simple lines and a streamlined longneck spout highlight the contemporary color scheme. For flexible functionality, the EZGrip dual-function pull-out wand easily switches between aerated stream and powerful spray. Soft rubber nozzles in the spray head prevent hard water and lime scale build-up, making maintenance easy. The KGU-413b 31 in. Undermount Single Bowl Kitchen Sink is handcrafted from 80% natural granite, with a clean, modern design that highlights the organic elegance of the material. The extra-deep basin accommodates all sizes of cookware, and has gently rounded corners for easy cleaning. The non-porous, naturally hygienic sink surface is protected with a thermal finishing process, making it highly resistant to heat, chemicals, scratching, chipping, and discoloration. This model is self-rimming, providing options for a simple way to create a finished look for your kitchen.Constructed from 80% natural graniteLooks and feels like real stoneNaturally sound-absorbing non-porous surface is hygienic and heat-resistantProtected by thermal finishing processHighly resistant to heat, chipping, and discolorationExtra-deep basin designStandard 3.5 in. drain openingGently rounded corners for easy maintenanceAll mounting hardware includedLimited lifetime warrantyInstallation type: undermountFaucet certifications: AB 1953, cUPC, NSF 61, CAL Green, DOE, FTC, NSF 372, CEC, MASS
