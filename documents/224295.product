Professional Strength, Remarkable Results Professional strength Melt is a unique formulation of calcium chloride pellets that accelerates the melting process by generating a large amount of heat on contact with snow and ice. Melt is designed to quickly, safely and effectively tackle frozen snow, sleet and ice on most driveways, steps, sidewalks and entryways. Melt pellets attract moisture from its surroundings, speeding up the creation of brine to quickly lower the freezing point of water, generate heat and melt snow and ice on contact. Packaged in a convenient, re-sealable bag for easy storage, Melt Calcium Chloride Pellets can be conveniently dispensed directly out of the bag or into a hand-held or wheeled salt spreader. Proven safe when applied as directed to "quality concrete" surfaces, Melt exhibits the following properties: Melts Down to -25F: Melt professional strength calcium chloride pellets effectively melt ice and snow on contact, even at temperatures as low as -25F. Instant Heat: Melt calcium-chloride pellets contain 94% pure calcium chloride to quickly generate heat upon and penetrate snow and ice up to 3 times faster than conventional ice melt. Long Lasting: Formulated to last up to 24 hours, Melt calcium chloride pellets go to work immediately upon contact with snow and ice and stay on the surface area longer for added protection and better control of the freeze/thaw cycle.Professional strength - contains 94% pure CaCl2 pelletsMelts down to -25FGenerates heat instantly upon contact with snow and iceConvenient re-sealable bag for easy storage and extended shelf-lifeLasts up to 24 hours for superior traction controlSafe for use on sidewalks when used as directed, never use any ice melt products on freshly poured concrete that has not had adequate time to cure
