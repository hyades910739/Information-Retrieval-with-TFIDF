Crown Bolt's Grade 8 cap screws are recommended for high stress applications and are among the strongest grade of fastener available in steel. The grade 8 bolt is compatible with grade 8 nuts and washers of the same thread pitch and diameter. An alternative for using them without nuts is to install them directly into a compatible female threaded hole.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 information1-piece per bagSteel constructionYellow zinc finish3/8 in. - 24 x 5 in.Grade 8Hex head
