Our bifold mirror closet doors are _ solid MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard) with the mirror laminated directly to the surface, creating a much safer pierce resistant mirror door. Most mirror doors are simply mesh backed mirror in a lightweight frame. This creates two issues; the mirror without a backing can become wavy plus the mirror has no solid backing of any kind. We believe the Impact Plus line of sliders are the safest mirror door on the market. In 1957, when our doors with _ solid MDF panels, our patented TruClose cam activated hinges and heavy duty hardware first hit the market it quickly became the top choice for Manhattan developers and architects. From Turner Construction when they built the Hofstra Dormitories on Long Island to HRH Construction when they built The Trump Towers, developers continue to purchase our Impact Plus bi-fold and sliding doors. Mir-Mel doors built on the success of our Impact Plus line and are the perfect marriage of safety and beauty.  We reduce the size of our full mirror, bevel the edges and mount it to the center of our panel, keeping the mirror back from the edge of the door eliminates the greatest risk of breaking, which is a hit within 1 in. of the edge of the mirror, that is why we offer a 5 year warranty on the Mir-Mel.PLEASE note that the Mir-Mel mirror is SURFACE MOUNTED to a solid MDF panel, although beveled on all sides to ease toward the panel, you will see the edge of the mirror from the sideThe solid backing makes them both impact and pierce resistantHeavy duty hardware ensures smooth quiet operationOne of a kind, TruClose cam activated hinges, a softer more definitive closeSmooth clean prefinished white finish will make a beautiful statement in any roomTrack comes in a matching white finishFully adjustable hardware allows both vertical and horizontal adjustments to obtain proper fit and operationBi-fold height is adjustable from 79 _ - 80 _ for 80 tall doors and 95 _ - 96 _ for 96 tall doorsUnfinished Hardwood saddle gives opening a finished look and prevents dust and debris from passing under the doorsBi-fold allows for full access, doors open toward the edge of the opening, allowing access to 90% of the closet's width when openedDimensions listed for this door are the finished openings they include room for the top and bottom track and saddle, it is not the height or width of the panels themselvesIf you "live" in your house and want it to not only last but be beautiful our doors are for you
