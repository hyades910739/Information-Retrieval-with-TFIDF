BEAPCO Drop-Ins Fruit Fly Traps give home owners 180 days of continuous fruit fly protection. The "food grade", non-toxic lure solution draws the fruit flies into the see-through traps where they are unable to escape. The patented, conical trap design also prevents the lure solution from spilling out from the traps, if it is dropped or knocked off the counter. Each trap lasts for 30 days with almost no monitoring or maintenance. Once the 30 days are up, simply dispose of the traps in your regular, household trash and replace with a new trap. Simple and effective. Each package comes with 6 fill-able traps and our patented non-toxic Lure Solution.Traps lasts up to 180 days of fruit fly trapping (30 days per trap)Innovative Drop-Ins trap system prevents fruit flies from escaping trap once they are caughtTraps are designed to prevent the lure solution from spilling out - even when tipped overClear trap design lets you know when fruit flies have been caughtPlace traps on or near countertops, fruit bowls, sinks, kitchen tablesTested and proven to catch 2X more fruit flies than leading brandsNon-toxic, food grade lure solution actively draws bed bugs into the clear trapsMade in CanadaSecondary testing has shown that BEAPCO's fruit fly traps capture 2.2X more than other household productsTo setup, simply fill each trap with the lure solution, up to the fill line and place on counter tops, near fruit or wherever you have problem areas
