Adams style Aluminum Fence combines the strength and beauty of wrought iron fences with the rust-free properties of aluminum. They can withstand years of moisture, wind, salt and chlorine without rusting or needing repainting. This fence will add prestige and value to any property. No other fence will do so much to enhance the beauty of your home, pool or yard. They are constructed from an exclusive high-strength aluminum alloy called HS-35. This remarkable material has the strength of steel (yield strength of 35,000 psi), but will never rust, even in coastal areas or around swimming pools. Jerith's durable powder coated finish is guaranteed not to crack, chip or peel for as long as you own your fence. Our coating is an environmentally safe, high quality alternative to paint. It is far more durable, fade-resistant and scratch resistant that other fence coatings, which is why we give a lifetime warranty on our products. All Jerith fences, gates and posts are assembled with hidden, stainless steel fasteners for outstanding corrosion resistance and strength. These hidden fasteners allow the fence sections to follow the slope of the ground without any modifications. Finally, our products are extruded, fabricated, coated and assembled entirely in the United States. We pride ourselves on being price competitive while still manufacturing our products in Philadelphia, as we have done for over 50-years.Elegant, traditional design adds prestige and value to any propertyDesign gives clear view into enclosed area for an open feelingPre-assembled for ease of installation and convenienceLimited lifetime warranty on workmanship, materials and coating for as long as you own your fenceLess than 4 in. between pickets and 46 in. rail spacing meets most swimming pool enclosure codes, check with your local building inspector before installing around a swimming poolMade in the United StatesAlso available in green, bronze and white finishes at Home Depot locations (not available online)Section will support 300 lb. load without permanent deformationFull sections can traverse up to a 22 in. incline from one side of the panel to the other6 ft.
