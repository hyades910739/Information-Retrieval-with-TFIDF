The 1/4 in. x 1/2 in. SharkBite Push-to-Connect x FNPT Adapter allows you to make a connection to 1/4 in. PEX pipe using a Push-to-Connect connection and then gives you a 1/2 in. Female NPT Adapter on the opposite end. SharkBite fittings are the easiest way to join copper, CPVC or PEX pipe in any combination with no soldering, clamps, unions or glue. Just insert the pipe and the stainless steel teeth bite down and grip tight, while a specially formulated O-ring compresses to create a perfect seal. Disassembly is just as fast using the simple disconnect tool so fittings and valves can be easily changed and reused. They can even be rotated after assembly for easier installation in tight spaces. SharkBite Fittings are certified for potable water supply and hydronic heating applications.
