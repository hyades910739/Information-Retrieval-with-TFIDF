This stunningly photographed book brims with simple, smart suggestions for transforming any room in your house-and outdoor spaces too. Each chapter covers a different technique or style, and all the ideas require little time or money. Pick a room and add drama with a single wall painted black; quiet it down with a cleverly placed lamp; create romance with swathes of curtains and drapes in your bedroom and much more. It's amazing-and amazingly easy.House and homeDecorating - generalDesignInterior decorating
