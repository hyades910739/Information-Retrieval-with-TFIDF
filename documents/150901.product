Diablo's Steel Demon Carbide-tipped reciprocating blades are the first carbide-tipped blades designed for extreme metal cutting; including high strength alloys, cast iron, and stainless steel. This high performance carbide-tipped blade delivers unmatched 20X longer cutting life than standard bi-metal blades in extreme thick metal cutting applications between 3/16 in. to 1/2 in. The increased blade body height produces straighter cuts with less vibration.High performance carbide for greater durability and cutting performance in thick metalEnhanced carbide tip to blade connection for extreme impact resistance1 in. oversized blade body for straighter cuts with less vibrationPerma-SHIELD non-stick coating for less heat and frictionIdeal for cutting stainless steel, cast iron, and other high strength alloys
