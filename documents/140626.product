This door has a woodgrain surface with an ovolo sticking profile. We understand your time is valuable and we want to make the process of updating your home as easy as possible. Our factory-finish doors have a beautiful smooth finish that you cannot achieve by painting your doors with a brush. One way JELD-WEN supports sustainable construction is by using recycled materials in the production of our Molded interior doors. In fact, these Molded door skins are made using 80% recycled content.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 informationBi-fold panel design matches the 2-Panel Eyebrow Top interior door when fully closedMatching slab and prehung passage doors also availableTextured woodgrain surface is pre-painted for convenienceAdjustable allowance of 1/2 in. on door height (1/4 in. from each side)Trimmable allowance of 1/2 in. on door width (1/4 in. from each side)5-Year limited warranty
