Whether you're working on a slippery garage floor, cleaning the cow barn, out on the tractor or just trekking in the snow, mud or rain is no problem with the BOGS Classic Series Mid Boot. Completely waterproof with a non-slip, non-marking and self-cleaning outsole, which washes clean with just a spray of the hose. The non-slip rubber soles provide excellent traction on both dry and wet surfaces. The boot has a natural hand-lasted rubber upper along with neoprene and a 4-way stretch inner bootie for a perfect fit. The BOGS Max-Wick pulls sweat away from your feet, keeping them dry and comfortable, which can often be the biggest challenge. Keep your boots free from odor-causing bacteria with BOGS DuraFresh bio-technology, while 7 mm of BOGS Neo-Tech insulation keeps your feet warm and comfortable from temperate to minus 40-degrees Fahrenheit. No matter the conditions, your feet will be dry, safe and comfortable in your BOGS Classic Mid Boots.100% waterproofNatural hand-lasted rubber and a 4-way stretch inner bootieBOGS Max-Wick pulls sweat away and helps keep feet dryConstructed with 7 mm BOGS neo-tech insulation for comfort rated from temperate to -40F or sub-zero conditionsDual-density, shock absorbing footbed with BOGS DuraFresh bio-technology to fight unwanted odorsNon-slip, non-marking and self-cleaning outsoleEasy-on pull handlesHeight 9 in. circumference at calf 14 in.Available in sizes 6 - 12
