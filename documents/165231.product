With flowers that are tall and elegant, our Lily Flowered Tulip Bulb Mix will bring grace and charm to the late spring garden. Shades of red, orange, yellow and white flowers, both solid and bi-colored, bloom atop strong, tall stems. The large thin blooms resembling lilies have elegant pointed petals. As they lengthen, they begin to open fully to a shape that is almost flat. Plant them in drifts or in spaces where color is needed. All 8 bulbs planted together in a single container will brighten a porch, patio, deck, or balcony. A single stem in a tall narrow vase is all that's necessary for a dramatic centerpiece.Easy to grow, carefree, strong, sturdy stemsExcellent cut flowerGrow 16 in. to 18 in. tallBloom late springHardy in zones 3-8Growing instructions: plant tulips outdoors in the fall about 6 to 8 weeks before the first hard frost, select a spot in the garden that receives full or afternoon sun and where the soil drains well, loosen the soil and plant the bulbs, pointy end up, approximately 6 in. to 8 in. deep and 5 in. apart, tamp down the soil and water well after planting, leave the foliage intact and cut only the stems to use as cut flowers, foliage should be left to die back naturally as it provides the nutrients the bulb will need to grow and flower the following yearPlanting tip: for a more natural look, plant tulips in clusters rather than in straight lines, remember that tulips do not like excessive moisture and should not be planted where they are watered by irrigation systems
