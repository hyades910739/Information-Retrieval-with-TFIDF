Each Detail K2 snow plow requires a custom mounting bracket designed specifically for your vehicle. These mounts are specially designed to bolt into existing holes in the vehicle frame, which eliminates the need for any drilling ensuring easy installation. Included in your mount kit are left hand and right hand bolt-on mount brackets, the cross member which acts as a bridge between the left and right hand brackets (the cross member is also the piece that will harness the snow plow to the vehicle). All installation hardware and hard copy installation instructions are also included. Please note that some mounting kits can fit multiple vehicle makes and models. It can be found in the "Info and Guides" section as a downloadable Installation Guide PDF.
