Blind rivets are tubular and are supplied with a mandrel through the center. The rivet assembly is inserted into a hole drilled through the parts to be joined and a specially designed tool is used to draw the mandrel into the rivet. This expands the blind end of the rivet and then the mandrel snaps off. Each rivet has a minimum and maximum grip range that allows for selection of the proper size based on combined thickness of the materials being joined together.California residents: see&nbsp;Proposition 65 information4-piece per bagStainless steel constructionStainless steel finish3/16 in. x 1/4 in.
