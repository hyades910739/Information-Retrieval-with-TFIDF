Designed to work with any DEWALT 18-Volt battery, this nailer provides fast, consistent nail penetration in both soft and hard materials. You can select sequential operating mode to ensure precision placement of each nail or a bump operating mode that allows you to harness top speed. A unique engine design allows this tool to work as fast as you do, firing up to 4 or five nails a second for increased productivity. And at just 8.8 lbs., this tool is lightweight for easy maneuvering and reduced operator fatigue. Whatever you're working on, you'll appreciate the little details that separate this intuitively designed tool from similar nailers. Integrated LED lights make it easy to ensure accuracy. An easy to operate contract trip lock-off disables the trigger when the tool is not in use for improved safety. The nosepiece is easy to access and clear tool-free if a nail jam occurs. And a six-position dial makes it simple to move between several applications without stopping to re-acquire exact depth settings, saving you time. Additionally, the 34 angled, rear-load magazine is easy to handle for quick refills and it will accept up to 110 DEWALT 34 nails. Included in this kit is a 1-hour charger, an 18-Volt XRP battery, a reversible belt hook that accommodates right and left-handed workers, a no-mar tip, safety glasses and a kit box for easy storage.Engine design allows the tool to work as fast as the end user with consistent nail penetration into both soft and hard jointsSequential operating mode allows for precision placement and the bump operating mode provides the user with production speedEasy access to the nosepiece for the removal of jammed nails without the use of screwdrivers or tool wrenchesContact trip lock-off allows trigger to be disabled when not in useIntegrated LED lights for long life and durabilityTop cap is impact resistant and easy to remove for troubleshootingReversible belt hook provides increased portability and versatility on the job-siteIncreased visibility and durability along with protection for work-surface from the contact-tripPart of the XRP DEWALT cordless system34 angled magazine (up to 110 nails capacity) will accept DEWALT or any competitive brand 34 15-Gauge standard DA type nails6 position dial allows the user to move between applications without having to re-acquire exact depth settingRear-load magazine offers loading styles which provide versatility to accommodate the end user's preferenceNeed help?
